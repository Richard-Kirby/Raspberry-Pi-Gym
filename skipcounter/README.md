This is the skipcounter app which counts number of skips (Total acceleration is all directions is > config value) and will also send this 
via UDP/IP to a server.  This application is recommended for a Raspberry Pi Zero due to the small size.  You need to add a I2C MPC6050 
accelerometer and a I2C OLED screen to get the functionality included.
