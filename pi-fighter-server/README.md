This is the code for the Pi Gym Server.  For now, it just gets UDP/IP messages from the heavy bag and the skip counter program. 
This was built to run on a PC, but should be able to run on anything with Python on it.  No special hardware needed.  Internet connection
is not needed but all the devices have to be accessible on the same network (assumed wireless, but should work fine as wired).
